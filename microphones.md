There are several different types of microphones available on the market. The differences in price, quality, and application are vast. The main intention behind the microphone often dictates which technology the user will opt for. 

A microphone is a transducer that converts sound into an electric signal. Microphones usually need to be collected to a preamplifier before the signal can be recorded or reproduced, for DSP audio processing and increasing the gain to a level which is workable or amplifiable for human hearing through speakers. 5


### History: 
The first microphone that actually allowed people to transfer or record their voices was the **carbon microphone**. Known as a "loose contact" microphone, this was developed by David Edward Hughes in England & Emile Berliner and Edison in the US. Edison was given the patent, but Hughes technically did it first (around 1877 for both).

Edison then refined the carbon microphone into the carbon-button transmitter in 1886. This was used at the first radio broadcast ever. 

Then, in 1916, we got the condenser mic. This was a moving coil created by Western Electronic. 

In 1923, the ribbon microphone broke through, which was another electromagnetic type. 

1. Dynamic Microphones: 
	1. this is the most common type of microphone
	2. uses a coil of wire suspended in a magnetic field
2. Condenser Microphone
	1. uses the vibrating diaphragm as a capacitor plate
3. Contact Microphone
	1. uses a crystal of piezoelectric material


### Condenser Microphones: 
aka: Capacitor Microphone, Electrostatic Microphone

- capacitors were historically called condensers, giving the microphone its name. 
	- the diaphragm acts as one plate of the capacitor
	- audio vibrations create changes in the distance between the plates
	- capacitance is inversely proportional to the distance, so changes in capacitance are used to measure the audio signal. 
	- assembly of fixed and movable plates is called an element or capsule
- can be found in phone mouthpieces to karaoke mics and high fidelity devices, very diverse in their applications. 
- they generally produce very high quality signals 
- are popular in laboratory and studio applications
	- this is due to the very small mass that must be moved by the incident sound wave compared to other mics that require the wave to do more work, and are thus more suited for small or soft sounds. 
- require a power source, which is usually provided via mic input or on equipment as [[phantom power]], or from a small battery
	- power is needed to establish the capacitor plate voltage and needed to power the electronics on the mic itself.
- condenser mics are also available with two diaphragms that can be electrically connected to provide a range of polar patterns
	- cardioid
	- omnidirectional
	- figure-eight
	- or varied continuously like in the Rode NT2000 or CAD M179
- two main categories of condenser mics: 
	- **DC Based mics**
		- plates are biased with a fixed charge Q
		- voltage maintained across the capacitor plates changes with vibrations in the air, according to C = Q/V
		- A nearly constant charge is maintained on the capacitor
		- As capacitance changes, the charge across the capacitor also changes very slightly, but at audible frequencies it is very constant. 
		- the capacitance of the capsule and the value of the bias resistor form a filter that is high pass for the audio signal, and low pass for the bias voltage.
		- remember $\tau$ = RC
		- the voltage difference is seen across the series resistor, and the microphone usually does not contribute any voltage gain and needs to be amplified for recording or performance. 
	- **Radio Frequency (RF)** or **High Frequency (HF)**
		- RF condensers use a relatively low voltage, which is generated by a low-noise oscillator
		- the signal from the oscillator may either be amplitude modulated by the capacitance changes produced by soundwaves or the capsule might be part of a resonant circuit that modulates the frequency of the oscillator signal
		- demodulation yields a low-noise audio frequency with very low source impedance 
		- the lack of high bias voltage allows the mic to have a looser diaphragm, and can sometimes get higher frequency response due to higher compliance
		- RF biasing processes also result in a lower electrical impedence capsule, which makes RF mics better in damp weather conditions that could otherwise create problems for DC mics with contaminated insulating surfaces
		- Sennheiser MKH mics use RF biasing techniques
	- Electret Condenser: 
		- this uses a permanent electrical charge in the electret material
			- electret = ferroelectric material that has been permanently electrically charged or polarized
			- basically a permanent magnet but with static charge
		- these have really low cost and ease of manufacture, and are the most commonly made nowadays
		- applications include: 
			- high quality lavalier mics, built in mics for recording devices, and headsets
		- these require no polarizing voltage, and instead usually have an onboard preamp that does need some power
			- this is usually phantom powered
	- Valve Microphone: 
		- a condenser mic that uses a vacuum tube amp. 
		- tube heads love these

### Dynamic Microphones
aka: Moving-voil microphone

- works via electromagnetic induction
- robust, relatively inexpensive, and resistant to moisture
- high gain before feedback
- very popular for on stage use
- use the same principle as a loudspeaker, but reversed
- a small movable induction coil is placed in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet, and is attached to the diaphragm
- sound enters the windscreen, the wave moves the diaphragm, which then moves the coil in the magnetic field, and that produces a varying voltage across the coil through electromagnetic induction

### Ribbon Microphones
- usually thin, corrugated metal ribbon suspended in a magnetic field.
- the ribbon is connected electrically to the mic output
- the ribbon's vibration within the field generates the electrical signal 
- similar to moving coil microphones in the sense that they both produce sound by magnetic induction 
- basic ribbon mics are bi-directional, aka figure-eight
	- this is because the ribbon is open on both sides
	- also, since the ribbon has less mass, it can respond to air velocity instead of pressure from the sound wave itself
- symmetrical front & rear pickup can sometimes be annoying for normal stereo recording, but high side rejection can be useful for recording instances such as trying to capture cymbals
	- place horizontally so the rear gets cymbal sound only
- crossed figure 8 or blumlein pair, is popular, and ribbons are usually chosen for this

- polar pattern indicates how sensitive it is to sounds arriving at different angles about its central axis
- omnidirectional mics are usually considered to be "perfect" in 3 dimensions, but in the real world this is usually not true
